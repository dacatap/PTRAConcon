    m_Localized: "Set of dunes located 98 feet above sea level, whose chronological
      origin dates from the quaternary, when the eolic erosion shaped the rocky surface
      of the area. A particular fact of this set of dunes is that despite that the
      sandy areas have not been sustained by the beaches, they\u2019ve remained stable.\r\n\r\nIt
      features coastal shrub vegetation and bushes located on the edges of the dune
      field and on the slopes facing towards the coastal avenue. The biological diversity
      of the zone is complemented with the presence of a variety of seabirds, standing
      out among them the rufous-chested plover and the sanderling, besides the sea
      lions and the Humboldt penguins.\r\nOn the coastal edge are preserved sea shells
      of great archaeological value.\r\nDeclared in 1993 as a Nature Sanctuary due
      to constituting a landscape unity between scenic, touristic and scientific
      value.\r"

    m_Localized: "The wetland \u201CParque Ecol\xF3gico La Isla\u201D is a space
      consisting of an unique ecosystem that contributes to the sheltering of a great
      biodiversity of flora and birds, with great potential and interest from the
      educative, touristic and scientific areas. It was designed as a conjoined effort
      between the Conc\xF3n city hall and ENAP, in a space that encompasses 32 acres.\r\n\r\nIt
      is home to significant colonies of kelp gulls, pelicans, Franklin's gulls,
      Wilson's phalaropes, black-necked stilts and other species such as band-tailed
      sierra finches, Magellan thrushes, long-tailed meadowlarks and american oystercatchers.
      Among the more common vegetation there\u2019s cattails and water lilies, which
      are hydrophilic and bear the fluctuation of saltwater and freshwater.\r"

      in the region, with a main focus on the history of the Bato culture, which
      dates between 800 BC to 800 AD. There\u2019s also exhibitions about other subjects
      such as the civil war of 1891 and a room dedicated to the singer-songwriter,
      Patricio Manns, known for songs such as Arriba en la Cordillera.\r\n\r\nAs
      a fun fact, a considerable amount of the material gathered and exhibited in
      the museum is not acquired just from archaeological excavations, but is donated
      from neighbors of the comunity.\r"

      archaeological, ecological and biological value, which has been preserved in
